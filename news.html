<h4>v0.90.85 for OS X 10.4 Tiger</h4>
<p>
	Thanks to our friend <em>maep</em>, your old Tiger can now also run the new MilkyTracker. Check out the <a href="?download">downloads</a>. The site and documentation also got a couple of fixes and <em>Valerio</em> tells us the quick reference printouts will soon be up to date. So if you're planning to print out and laminate and/or frame some PDFs, you might want to wait over the weekend.

<div class="section">
<h4>New release: MilkyTracker v0.90.85</h4>
<p>
	A new year, a new release.  This release contains many bug-fixes, several small additions/improvements and a change of license for MilkyTracker's player library (MilkyPlay) from GPL to BSD (meaning you are now free to use it in your own applications/demos/games without having to release your source code.  Note: the rest of MilkyTracker remains GPL).  The user manual and FAQ have also been updated.

<h4>Port round-up</h4>
<p>
	Since the release of MilkyTracker v0.90.80 as open source, new software distributions have been adopting it at a steady pace. The long-awaited Ubuntu package is also out already, and has been for a while too! Yeah, we didn't know either for quite some time, due to a delay on the package search page we were monitoring. Other distributions that nowadays offer MilkyTracker include (but aren't necessarily limited to) Arch Linux, Debian, Enlisy, FreeBSD, Gentoo, NetBSD and SUSE. Let us know if there's more.
</p>
<p>
	Varthall's port for Amiga OS 4 was done in due time and we're awaiting to hear about more positive developments from the Amiga front. Also, by request, a G3 compatible OS X version was built.

</p>
<p>
	We would like to remind people that if they're doing something interesting with the source code, please let us know so we can spread the news. That's about it, nothing big, but at least I got to clean up the news page a little. ;)

<div class="section">
<h4>MilkyTracker v0.90.80 is out</h4>
<p>
	This is a big release for us and we hope you'll like it too. As usual, the new version fixes several bugs and replay issues but more interestingly, the code refactoring has resulted in two things: A) Cool new features. B) MilkyTracker is now open source (<abbr title="GNU General Public License"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a></abbr>). That's right, dig in, patch, port, maintain, you are welcome to do so. Linux distributions can also now include MilkyTracker in their sofware repositories, so spread the word. We'd also like to see some quality player plugins and whatnot come out of this.
</p>
<p>
	You might have already noticed but with the new release, the website was also rebooted and the <a href="docs/MilkyTracker.html">manual</a> now has a comprehensive list of the <a href="docs/MilkyTracker.html#effects">effect commands with their explanations</a>. Hoping to serve you better and all in all, provide a better MilkyTracker experience. If you're still reading this, now would be a good time to stop and go get your copy of MilkyTracker from <a href="?download">downloads</a>.
