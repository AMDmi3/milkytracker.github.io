<h4>
	A couple of facts:

	<li>MilkyTracker development started a decade later for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_PC">Pocket PC</a> and it still fully operates on rather humble PDAs.</li>
	<li>MilkyTracker is and will stay a 2nd generation tracker. There are already several good 3rd generation trackers out there.</li>
</ul>
