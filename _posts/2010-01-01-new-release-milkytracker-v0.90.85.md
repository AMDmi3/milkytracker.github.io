A new year, a new release.  This release contains many bug-fixes, several small additions/improvements and a change of license for MilkyTracker's player library (MilkyPlay) from GPL to BSD (meaning you are now free to use it in your own applications/demos/games without having to release your source code. Note: the rest of MilkyTracker remains GPL). 

The user manual and FAQ have also been updated.

Please read the [ChangeLog][changelog] for more details.
