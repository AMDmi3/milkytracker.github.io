After a bit of a hiatus, the MilkyTracker team are pleased to announce a brand-new release - *v1.0.0*.

This release incorporates the usual bug-fixes and enhancements, as well as some major plumbing work (thanks to d0pefish) to ensure MilkyTracker will continue to run on modern systems well into the 21st Century.

Please refer to our detailed [ChangeLog]({% link docs/ChangeLog.md %}) for details of the changes since the previous release. Head over to the [GitHub release page][gitrel] to obtain the OSX/Windows binaries, or the source code to build your own.

Happy tracking!
