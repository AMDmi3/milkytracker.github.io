Thanks to our friend *maep*, your old Tiger can now also run the new MilkyTracker. Check out the [downloads][downloads]. The site and documentation also got a couple of fixes and *Valerio* tells us the quick reference printouts will soon be up to date. So if you're planning to print out and laminate and/or frame some PDFs, you might want to wait over the weekend.
